# IP-Address-Finder
With the help of splay tree data structure, we would create a tree whose nodes are
embedded with the Ip address of the device that are connect to a specific network router. In our
code we have taken 11 devices connected to one network router and so there would be some
common part in the Ip address of each of the devices. Now, router gets some specific data
packets from the net which is supposed to be given to a specified device and so it uses searching
operation to find the correct Ip address. To increase the speed of this process we use splay tress
for searching and inserting the Ip addresses. It is the fastest data structure for searching
operation. Therefore, the router sends the data packet to the specified Ip address when multiple
devices are connected. Here we have used the random function to input the data packets so that
there is no input function required and the processes is completely automatic as it takes place in
network router.
